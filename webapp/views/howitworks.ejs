        <div class="abouttext">Based on a 2014 Pew Research Center study, we identified news sources based on the ideological composition of their audiences. First, we looked at the plot below, which shows us 30 news sources plotted on a liberal vs conservative scale.

        <br>
        <div class="abouttext">Next, we looked at an infographic which shows the most trusted news sources based on five ideological categories defined by the study: Consistently Liberal, Mostly Liberal, Mixed, Mostly Conservative, Consistently Conservative.

        <br>
        <div class="abouttext">We decided to combine the information from both plots to define news sources that not only represent varying perspectives, but also represent the most trusted sources. Based on this plot, we chose the following most trusted sources:
          <div>1. Consistently Liberal: NPR, PBS, and BBC</div>
          <div>2. Mostly Liberal: CNN and NBC </div>
          <div>3. Mixed: ABC and CBS </div>
          <div>4. Mostly Conservative: FOX </div>
          <div>5. Consistently Conservative: Hannity, Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck</div>
